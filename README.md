# ðŸ‘‹ My digital home [alex-grsm.github.io](https://alex-grsm.github.io/)
As a Full-Stack Developer, I have extensive experience building projects of various complexity, leveraging a wide array of CMS platforms and frameworks to meet diverse client needs.
My expertise extends beyond Full-Stack development, as I am proficient in working with APIs and integrating multiple technologies to deliver seamless and user-friendly experiences.
I take pride in combining design, technology, and user experience to create impactful web solutions. With strong problem-solving abilities and excellent communication skills, I work effectively within teams and excel at explaining technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
