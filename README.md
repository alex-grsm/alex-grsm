# ðŸ‘‹ My digital home [alex-grsm.github.io](https://alex-grsm.github.io/)
As a front-end developer, I have a diverse range of experience working on projects of varying complexity using different CMS and frameworks. Through my work, I have developed strong front-end development skills, which enable me to create engaging and visually appealing websites and web applications.

In addition to my front-end development skills, I am also experienced in working with APIs and have a good understanding of how to integrate different technologies to create seamless experiences for users. I am always eager to learn and stay up-to-date on the latest developments in the field, which allows me to adapt to new frameworks and tools as needed.

Overall, I take pride in my ability to bring together design, technology, and user experience to create effective and engaging web experiences for clients. My problem-solving skills and communication abilities allow me to work effectively in teams and effectively communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
